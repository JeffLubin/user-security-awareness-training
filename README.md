# User Security Awareness Training Campaign

## Project Objective

This project aims to provide a comprehensive user security awareness training campaign. It includes training modules, campaign assets, quizzes, feedback mechanisms, framework alignment documentation, and a lessons learned section for a personal retrospective.

## Modules

The training campaign covers the following modules:
*   Phishing Awareness
*   Password Hygiene
*   MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
*   Data Handling & Case Study
*   Remote Work Security & Checklist

## Framework Alignment

This campaign aligns with the following security frameworks:

| Framework             | Control/Reference        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| NIST SP 800-50        | Program Development      |
| ISO 27001             | A.7.2.2 Security awareness |
| NIST CSF              | PR.AT-1                  |

## How it aligns

### üìò NIST SP 800-50 ‚Äì Building a Security Awareness Program
- Phishing Awareness: Educates users on social engineering threats.
- Password Hygiene: Promotes secure authentication practices.
- MFA: Explains layered security and its importance.
- Data Handling: Covers proper handling of sensitive and personal data.
- Remote Work Security: Delivers contextual training based on modern working environments.

### üîê ISO/IEC 27001 A.7.2.2 ‚Äì Security Awareness, Education, and Training
- Phishing Awareness: Reinforces the importance of identifying threats.
- Password Hygiene: Aligns with organizational password policies.
- MFA: Demonstrates the use of strong authentication techniques.
- Data Handling: Supports compliance with data protection responsibilities.
- Remote Work Security: Ensures awareness of evolving security protocols for remote access.

### üß† NIST CSF PR.AT-1 ‚Äì Users Are Informed and Trained
- All Modules: Ensure users receive structured and relevant training.
- Quizzes & Feedback: Measure user understanding and retention.
- Communication Assets: Simulate organization-wide campaign rollout through email and chat.
