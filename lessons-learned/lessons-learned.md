# 📘 Lessons Learned – My Take on Building a Security Awareness Campaign

I decided to make this one of the four projects I presented in my resume because I wanted to understand what it actually *feels like* to be the person behind the policy. The one responsible for writing and edcuating an entrie organiztion, And to be honest, I learned a lot.

I used to think most people are just purely lazy, which is why they skip or ignore security. But the reality is most people don’t ignore security because they’re lazy. They ignore it because it’s confusing, time-consuming, or doesn't feel personal. They have no real reason to attach it to themselves.

As somebody who’s deep in this space, it’s easy to forget that not everybody actually cares that much about tech or security. We often sell the *features* security has to offer, not the *benefits*.

That’s what I wanted to showcase in my videos and it’s why I kept the content short and human. Nobody wants to sit through a 20-minute video during work hours. They already have enough on their plate.

I noticed that when you put a little effort and personality into content, it feels real and authentic. I had to think like a content creator in a sense because I’m not just informing, I’m also fighting for attention.

Security awareness isn’t about scaring people into compliance. It’s about meeting them where they are and giving them just enough to make a smarter decision.

## 📊 Frameworks don’t inspire behavior — storytelling does

I referenced NIST and ISO because I wanted to do this the “right” way. But what I realized is that *how* you deliver matters more than what’s on the checklist.

Telling someone “this maps to ISO 27001 A.7.2.2” means nothing unless they understand *why* that matters for their role. My videos weren’t just about controls—they were about habits. That was intentional. I want them to see themselves through me.

## 🧰 I saw how GRC is part strategy, part empathy, part systems thinking

This project helped me realize the GRC function isn’t just documentation and risk registers—it’s the intersection of:
- Strategy (why this policy, for this team, at this time?)
- Empathy (how do we make this usable?)
- Systems thinking (how do we scale it without breaking it?)

That mindset shift is what I’m carrying forward.
