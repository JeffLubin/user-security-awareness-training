# ðŸ“§ Security Awareness Training: Email Series

## Week 1 â€“ Phishing Awareness

**Subject:** Think before you click â€” how to spot a phishing attack

Hi team,

Weâ€™re kicking off our Security Awareness Campaign this week with a short, practical video on one of the biggest threats to any organization: phishing.

These attacks are getting more convincing every year! Fake logins, spoofed emails, urgent requests that seem legit. It only takes one click to compromise a whole system.

Thatâ€™s why this weekâ€™s training matters.

ðŸŽ¥ [Watch the 3-min video](#)  
âœ… [Take the short quiz](#)

**Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll learn:**  
- What phishing really looks like (not just the obvious stuff)  
- How to spot red flags before you click  
- What to do if you think somethingâ€™s off  

Even if youâ€™ve seen phishing emails before, this is a quick refresh that can save a lot of headaches down the line for both you and the team.

Thanks for being part of this.  
More to come next week.

## Week 2 â€“ Password Hygiene

**Subject:** Your password isnâ€™t as strong as you think

Hi team,

This week, we're covering one of the most overlooked areas in security: password hygiene.

Weak, reused, or guessable passwords are still one of the easiest ways attackers get in â€” and the truth is, most of us donâ€™t realize how vulnerable we are until itâ€™s too late.

ðŸŽ¥ [Watch the 3-min video](#)  
âœ… [Take the short quiz](#)

**Youâ€™ll walk away knowing:**  
- How to build strong, memorable passphrases  
- Why password managers are worth using  
- What *not* to do (like using the same password for multiple logins)

This oneâ€™s quick, but important. Strong passwords arenâ€™t about being paranoid â€” theyâ€™re about being smart.

## Week 3 â€“ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Subject:** MFA: The easiest security win youâ€™re probably skipping

Hi team,

This weekâ€™s module is about Multi-Factor Authentication A.

If your password is your house key, MFA is the deadbolt. And in todayâ€™s environment, just one layer of protection isnâ€™t enough.

ðŸŽ¥ [Watch the 3-min video](#)  
âœ… [Take the quick quiz](#)

**What weâ€™ll cover:**  
- What MFA is (and how it works behind the scenes)  
- Why it stops 90%+ of common account attacks  
- Where and when you should be using it (spoiler: everywhere)

If you havenâ€™t set it up across all your accounts, this is the week to get it done. Simple step, major impact.

## Week 4 â€“ Data Handling & PII

**Subject:** If itâ€™s personal, itâ€™s protected â€” how to handle sensitive data

Hi team,

Letâ€™s talk about data â€” specifically, how to handle sensitive information the right way.

From customer records to internal spreadsheets, we all interact with data that deserves protection. This weekâ€™s video walks you through the basics of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and how to avoid unintentional leaks.

ðŸŽ¥ [Watch the 3-min video](#)  
âœ… [Take the short quiz](#)

**Youâ€™ll learn:**  
- What counts as PII (itâ€™s more than just names)  
- Where accidental exposure usually happens  
- How to handle sensitive data securely, even in day-to-day tasks

Quick reminder: security isnâ€™t just about firewalls and passwords â€” itâ€™s about decisions we make every day.

## Week 5 â€“ Remote Work Security

**Subject:** Working remote? Hereâ€™s how to stay secure from anywhere

Hi team,

To wrap up our Security Awareness Campaign, weâ€™re closing out with one of the most relevant topics in 2024: staying secure while working remotely.

Whether you're at home, at a coffee shop, or working while traveling â€” your workspace still needs to be locked down.

ðŸŽ¥ [Watch the 3-min video](#)  
âœ… [Take the final quiz](#)

**In this module:**  
- How to stay safe on public Wi-Fi  
- Why your router and personal devices matter  
- Remote work red flags to avoid

Thank you for engaging with this campaign â€” taking a few minutes each week to level up your awareness goes a long way in keeping our team and data safe.
